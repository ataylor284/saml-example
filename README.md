SAML Example
============

A simple SAML application built with opensaml and pac4j to understand the SAML webflow.

An example SAML authentication webflow:

There are three parties involved in the authentication: the user's
browser, the Service Provider (SP) - saml-example in this example, and
the Identity Provider (IDP).  The IDP can be any SAML 2.0 identity
provider.

The negotiation looks like this:

First, note that the SP and IDP never directly interact.  All the
requests go from browser to SP or browser to IDP.

Request 1 is to a secure resource on the SP.  The SP doesn't have an
authenticated session for the browser, so it returns a special "SAML
Login 1" response.  This is generated by pac4j and opensaml in
saml-example.  The response is a form that auto-submits itself
(request 2) to the IDP.  The form includes a SAMLRequest parameter
that encodes it's identity.

The IDP determines the user is not yet authenticated, and presents a
login form where the user enters their IDP creds (requests 3 and 4).

The response to the successful login is another auto-submitting form,
this time with a SAMLResponse parameter.  This is auto-sumbitted to
the SP callback URL.

When the form is submitted the SP decodes the SAMLResponse and gets
the user credentials and profile.  Done!

Using the example
-----------------

Create a java keystore and create a key pair with alias saml in the current directory.

    keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias saml -keypass changeit -keystore trust.keystore -storepass changeit

Copy the IDP metadata XML document to
src/main/resources/idp-metadata.xml.  Build, run and browse to
localhost:8080.
